<h3 style="color:white;">paragraph breaks are unhealthy, so i wrote more than 5000 words about the deciding factors of the Soviet hegemonial collapse without them</h3>

<p style="color:white;">The Soviet Union could actually be seen as an operational government, because right after it collapsed lots of problems occurred in the country. Of course, the Soviet Union wasn&rsquo;t good, but it was better than right after it collapsed. Forcing democracy in a country that for years has lived under one-party rule leads to chaos and takes a while to rebuild, and that&rsquo;s why Russia wasn&rsquo;t that big of a deal in the 90s, but during the 2010s, has become a great power with an example being the Crimea crisis in 2014. No one wanted to attack each other due to both Russia now becoming a great power and its control over nuclear warheads. Ukraine has become a hotspot between the European Union and Russia, which wouldn&rsquo;t have happened during the transitional period that it had to go through after it collapsed. Russia acting phlegmatic during its transitional period helped it rise as a great power, with lots of rebuilding occurring and being weak. It&rsquo;s surprising that no nation attempted to invade it during this period of rebuilding inside of the country. This strategic time during its history was extremely volatile, and depended on what person was elected in office to change the nation. You may have already seen this with China, as it has already spread its power across the world with plans in Africa and products being exported to America. Africa is also in this transitional period, with child mortality going down and industry rising. China has gone through a transitional period itself, as during the 1950s and 1960s The Great Leap Forward caused much of the country to increase its industry during this period. This is why China has a large influence over the world, as it requires more and more from the population to produce materials to help construction. When China broke away from the Soviet Union with the Sino-Soviet split, China was declaring itself independent from another country partially controlling it. However, they did have a symbiosis relationship supporting each other with alliances between the two could&rsquo;ve helped each other, however China declared itself independent from the Soviet Union when the Sino-Soviet split occurred, making it applicable to do more reforms within the country. A new form of communism was created inside of China, called Maoism, created by Mao Zedong to further apply its influence to other countries. Russia is already seen spreading its influence to countries that also collapsed from the Soviet Union, with them rebuilding as well. An example is Kazakhstan, one of the SSR&rsquo;s inside of the Soviet Union which declared independence. Every single SSR in the Soviet Union broke away, and with CSTO, Russia and other members that are rebuilding can control an influence around the world. After the 2010s, America&rsquo;s influence around the world was removed after Russia and China arrived. Once a country goes through a rebuilding period, it always finds a way to have some form of influence. Germany, after being divided for almost 50 years, went through rebuilding and is a major member of the European Union. The United States, although not going through a major war and destroying its industry, did increase its industry during World War II bringing it out of the Great Depression. The Great Depression could be seen as the &ldquo;war&rdquo; that America rebuilt from to become a major power, and without the Great Depression the United States would have not likely increased its industry as much. During the Great Depression, lots of people lost jobs and therefore when job opportunities were given when a World War occurred, the industry was able to rise. For the Soviet Union during the Great Depression, it helped increase the power of Stalin in his rule, increasing the industrial power of the Soviet Union, however during the great purge, much of this industrial power was weakened, with incompetent generals and leaders put in place of the army and military, a perfect time for someone to invade. The German industry during this time boomed, but the one problem was that there was no oil to help the German tanks and planes. The Soviet Union after being invaded by Germany was in shambles due to most of the infrastructure being destroyed after major battles. An extreme example is Stalingrad, a city that was destroyed after lots of fighting within it. Leningrad, a city that was under siege for most of the war, had much of its population starving. When the Soviet Union finally won over Germany, it set up puppet states which halted the development of countries in east Europe. These puppet states had its leaders put in place, which led to most of the people now being under control over a dictator they did not want. This idea for the people relatively stopped the progress and innovations. However, in the west side of Europe, they were extremely wealthy and were able to make innovations, allowing them to rebuild. That may be the reason why the United States won the cold war in the first place, many of these countries were not able to rebuild. If the Sino-Soviet split did not happen, perhaps China would have also collapsed into a country like Russia, becoming a (failed) democracy, leading to rebuilding occurring later. The people of Russia have dealt with a long amount of turmoil within the government. Especially after the collapse, many people had to deal with large amounts of problems. The Russian Empire before World War I was a destabilized country that was not controlled very well by the Tsar. When World War I began, the German Empire (not the nazis or the Germans today) was in a two-front war between the east and the west. These are referred to as the western front and the eastern front in both World War I and World War II. For World War I, Germany at the beginning already had to deal with two fronts, unlike Germany in World War II. During this period between 1914 and 1915, trenches were created and barely any land was able to be conquered from the opposite side. The soldiers on the Russian side were completely unprepared for this invasion, and Germany knew this. Germany decided to quickly deal with Russia then focus on the Western Front and take out France. Their plan after that was to get the United Kingdom out of the war and surrender afterwards. How does that have to do with the Russian people, you may ask? Since there were a large amount of trenches, and like said earlier, no land was able to be gained, this greatly decreased the morale of the Russian people who were behind in technology and were not reaching enough resources from a blockade that Germany backed. Russia had a civil war between the Communist Party and the Tsar, and the Communist Party won. Right after they won, the Communist Party sued for peace from the Germans and backed out of the war. Then, once Germany lost World War I, the Soviets were able to take back Ukraine and Belarus. With the new communist party in power in Russia, the people were relatively happy that the Tsar was gone from power. This catalyzed what happened later in the Russian government, with the people happy that their government was in power, they were able to spread propaganda to the people to forget about the rest of the world. The rest of the world, such as the United States, would&rsquo;ve been seen as a wonderful haven for the soviet people if they saw what their country is actually like. Another part of what caused the soviet government to collapse is likely the spread of free speech and information. This made the people rebel from the soviet government leading to the collapse of itself. The reason that free speech against the government led to the collapse could be seen in Chernobyl. The failure of the government to reveal what actually happened in the situation made the people feel untrustworthy about the government, leading to the collapse. Gorbachev said that &ldquo;Chernobyl, not Peristoka, caused the Soviet Union to collapse. &hellip; The Chernobyl disaster, more than anything else, opened the possibility of much greater freedom of expression, to the point that the system as we knew it could no longer continue.&rdquo; The Napoleonic Wars may also be a catalyst towards the Tsar government being deposed. When Napoleon invaded Russia, they had to burn down stuff along the way, as well as Moscow. This was due to Napoleon&rsquo;s army living off the land and not using supply trains. Napoleon with supply trains was slow and not able to make as many victories due to it. However, as you may think, some of the Russian people would starve due to the lack of food in the country due to them burning it down. A reason why the Russian government works today is that they divide their country into different regions that contain indigenous people, and essentially are not ruled by the Russian government. This prevents the chance of rebellions as they do not need to declare independence as they almost have independence themselves. A reason why Russia during World War I was not ready and was not in the industrial revolution as soon was due to the Mongols taking over them. The Mongols took over them and instead of reforming to them, as many conquerors do, they reformed Russia to their type of government. This set back Russia for many years due to the killings of many people in this time. In the north of Russia, the Novgorod Republic, was an important trading area with Europe, and was the only part of Russia during the 9th to 13th century that was prosperous. When the Mongols invaded, they completely destroyed this prosperity when they changed the government and purged lots of government officials. Back to somewhere around the time period of World War I, another reason why the Tsar government may have collapsed is that during the Japanese-Russian war over Manchuria, Russia lost the war and was a big blow to their country and morale. This may have caused the civil war in Russia to occur faster or even make the civil war occur at all. The threat of nuclear warheads for the Soviet people may have been a reason for the collapse of the Soviet Union. The threat of an all-out nuclear war between the two nations would have scared the Soviet people if they got out. With the spread of free speech in the Soviet Union due to Gorbachev, this threat was more and more shown to the Soviet people, causing them to rebel and causing it to collapse. This led to Russia being in a position that is not good for a country to be in. Communism may have even influenced the way that the Russian democracy works today, due to Putin&rsquo;s foreign policy and with Russia being relatively hostile towards America itself. Russia, with CSTO and the influence of Ukraine and the European Union, has attempted to control the trade in the European Union. Russia needs a steady supply of exports and imports to survive as a nation, due to the fact that there are heavy winters in the country. Russia needs to have an influence over Turkey due to the Black Sea having an important canal into the Black Sea, making trade possible. If Turkey decided to block the canal into the Black Sea, and if winter is occuring freezing the Baltic Sea in the north, this can cripple Russia and cause the population to starve from it. This makes imports and exports in Russia volatile, with Turkey and the seasons controlling what comes in and out. However, another important port that Russia has is Vladivostok. If foreign powers block trade in Europe, they could rely on Vladivostok in the east of Russia on the coastline of the Pacific Ocean. This relies on the fact that Russia has a working train system and railroads that go from the west of the country to the east of the country. However, if they were able to block Vladivostok from trade, the entire country of Russia would starve. It still takes a while for Russian trains to arrive in Moscow and the west, making it not reliable for the nation to use it. If nuclear warheads were not involved, bombing the railroads could cripple Russia&rsquo;s train network, leading to starving across the country. However, having nuclear warheads makes this not possible with M.A.D not make countries even attempt to bomb anything of Russia. When we talked about Chinese intervention in Africa, I forgot to mention that Russia is also attempting influence in Africa, as like I said earlier that the industrialization of Africa can easily be manipulated and is great for countries to ally with them. Africa&rsquo;s position on the world stage is, like I said just a moment ago, easy to manipulate, with the fact that child mortality is decreasing and education increasing, controlling Africa is a necessity with all the new jobs being created, with an amazing workforce to help nations spread their influence. There is a threat that Africa&rsquo;s population will explode (metaphorically, i do not support exploding africa&rsquo;s population), leading to overpopulation in the country, however contraceptives may be introduced that will still lead to Africa being an interesting part of the global stage. Beyond the 2020s and during the 2020s, a new space race may occur between nations. It may mainly be between China and the United States, however Russia may be a major part in this. After all the advancements made in the first space race only to lose it with incompetence and lack of resources, the Russian people are more likely going to try and defeat the United States in this new form of space race. However, this space race may be more dragged out, as the colonization of Mars may be into play here, and that takes months to even years to get to. With the advancements of society going faster and faster and the singularity approaching, the space race between these nations may start to get tense. Not only M.A.D. is at play here, there are even more nations involved in making the decision of not 1 out of 2 countries, but 1 out of several countries leading to the destruction of all humanity. The bellicose personality of all countries may actually prevent M.A.D. due to the fact that nations probably won&#39;t launch missiles to the other due to fear. However, mistakes may occur, leading to M.A.D, and most governments are extremely serious about mistakes, especially about nuclear warheads getting dropped on their nation. Advanced Intelligence (AI) may as well fix this, making safeguards to prevent such a thing from happening, however if we put AI in power of nuclear warheads themselves and launch something when detected, the idea of M.A.D may get out of control for most nations leading to more collapsing. Another minor factor of the collapse of the Soviet Union was Afghanistan. The Soviet Union suffered a major defeat when conquering Afghanistan and (in some form), led to 9/11. The Soviet&rsquo;s chauvinistic ideals and foreign policy to other nations and control them could be seen also with proxy wars. During the cold war, there were many different civil wars in nations, mainly between Communism and Anti-Communism. Communism, while not considering people, can be seen as a good way to control a nation. Without the worry of the people voting a leader that will essentially remove what the last leader did (a problem with America&rsquo;s democracy as a whole), reforms can be made quickly and easily. You do not see many Monarchy governments today as usually bringing propaganda across a nation is relatively difficult alone, however with communism there is a huge amount of people in the government supporting this form of propaganda, hindering the people from letting them have a say in government. Invading Afghanistan was a big mistake from the beginning, and the Soviet government made a major mishap while trying to invade a completely mountain nation using warfare made for plains. This mainly came from World War II, due to the German government using the plains in the Soviet Union to make quick gains into them. During winter, the Soviet government was able to bounce back and make the war turn into a partial stalemate except for the southern part of the Eastern front of the war. The worst decision a nation can make is an attempt to invade a mountainous nation without extreme prior planning. When the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, the United States set up a dictator to help fight against the Soviet Union. This did in fact work, although to soon bite America in the back afterwards. Installing a dictator controlled by a foreign power is bound to lead to something wrong, as seen with many countries and even some Central American countries referred to as the banana republics. Getting into a war with smaller nations is relatively meretricious, mainly due to the middle ages and there being no form of casus belli most of the time. Small nations nearby were seen as lagniappe for them, however later in the history of the world there would have to be casus belli, and invading countries could anger the United Nations or other alliances that propose peace. The origins of morality for humans is rather unknown. We just think that logically that people should have a moral compass and act accordingly. However, what says we should have a moral compass in the first place? Russia acting bellicose to other nations is not against any moral compass. China does it as well, attempting to keep their government in state. China is also bellicose in the way that attempting to keep over a billion people at bay in a communist dictatorship is rather difficult. There is the great Chinese firewall, where China has its own internet and programs to essentially spy on the population. China&rsquo;s population has a problem deciding whether anything is verisimilitude at all, showing the effectiveness of their leadership and applications put into place. Many of the applications of the Soviet Union are still in China, even though they did traduce them. Perhaps the effectiveness of the Soviet Union is best shown here. Communism is able to brainwash citizens and create a controllable country, as shown earlier. The spread of food across nations may actually cause wars if threatened, since food is a major part of countries. Agriculture and its effects around the world has caused lots of competition between countries and people themselves. The juxtaposition between both India and China could be seen as a Yin-Yang. India, a country that has lived under British rule for hundreds of years and used to its full extent, India has become central around exporting goods to other countries. China is also similar, in the way that it was also used for goods and many different resources. However, where the similarities end is that China was not conquered and used to its full extent. There are also differences leading back to the beginning of humanity, however I cannot explain the entire history of both China and India. I may explain, though, that the mountain ranges between them have caused a severe divide between both of them. China has control over a huge amount of trade while India does not. India does have experience with trade, however the reason that India has less experience with exporting goods to others is that China has been trading with Europe for many years. There is a large amount of history behind this, even before the silk road was created. The silk road was a major part in why trade between China and Europe was so successful. The reason for that is since there are mountains and a bunch of terrain blocking the way into Europe, trade without any form of landmarked road would be severely difficult. The discovery of the Americas was actually heavily influenced by China itself, with the access way into Asia through boats blocked by the Ottoman Empire and the silk road basically unused at this point, Spain and Portugal were trying to find other ways to trade with China. When the Americas were discovered, the continents&#39; languages were divided by the conquerors, and the cultures themselves they created were also changed by the conquerors. The introduction of different plagues into the Americas almost removed indigineous cultures themselves, with much of their population being killed off. The replacements were almost European cultures, with a small amount of the indigineous cultures left to replace them. However, over time the European cultures were removed due to revolutions against their conquerors. This is especially shown in South America, where a large amount of revolutions occurred against Spain and Portugal. This is the antithesis of Russian culture, where their ideas were taken from the Mongols when they were conquered. Over time though, Russia has made a culture themselves, away from Mongol culture. Russia has industrialized over time and has reached the same amount of technology as Europe. The origin of North American culture is somewhat similar, north of Central America there seems to be less nations, with the exception of the Caribbean. The Spanish people when conquering South America, Central America and the Caribbean may have actually preserved the cultures. In North America, there are only two different nations that are English, which is the United States and Canada. Canada has been under British rule longer than the United States, with full independence from the British crown in 1982. It seems that not adopting cultures and completely removing them is a way to keep countries loyal to you. There are many other factors to this, such as taxing and how you treat your colonies, however treating your colonies well while not adopting certain cultures seems to prolong control. The revolutions of colonies are not completely factored by culture, as for Spain the reasons the revolutions occured in the first place was due to the Peninsular war. The occupation of Spain by Napoleon seemed to have caused the revolutions in the first place, with them questioning their allegiance to Spain. Napoleon seems to have caused revolutions all across Europe, spreading democratic ideas to those along the way. The revolution in the Soviet Union may have actually been inspired by Napoleon, with the idea to go against a strong central government that did not care for the people. The Soviet Union exploited this weakness when they declared a revolution. The Nazis may also be similar to the Soviet Union in the way that they also exploited the population. However, instead of one single party exploiting the population it was by the control of a single person: Hitler. Germany recognized Hitler during World War Ii as a god. When Hitler attempted to spread Nazism, he had to show himself as a god and a protector of Germany. However, during the end of the war, he had one problem, and that was that he couldn&rsquo;t show himself as a god anymore. He was losing the war and the population was noticing that. Hitler wanted to see himself as the likes of Napoleon and one of the greatest conquerors of the world. His ideas were childish and he was also able to manipulate the child population. Since children are extremely gullible and do not realize the truth. The Hitler Youth was an easy way to control the children, and after 1933 the population of the Hitler Youth skyrocketed to millions. With so many children under control and brainwashed by the Nazi party, Hitler almost had full control over the German population. Hitler also created more railroads to expand and reconstruct the economy after the Great Depression, making their economy extremely efficient and built for war. However, most of the time when the war is on a country&#39;s doorstep, it causes chaos and the economy fails. This failure for Germany&rsquo;s economy was not realized until the war actually went into the Rhine, the heartland of the German industry. Without their industry they could not survive the war. The battle of the Bulge was the last attempt Germany had to save their industry and save the war. Another industry destroyed by war is Japan, due to Americas firebombing and nuclear bombing. Japan would&rsquo;ve never surrendered no matter what, even if firebombing occured. The reason why Japan gave up in the first place was due to Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Manchuria, a direct reference to what happened in the Russo-Japanese war. Japan figured that if they surrendered quick enough, America would be lenient towards them. If the war was prolonged, Russia could&rsquo;ve invaded the island and would&rsquo;ve been divided between the nations. In retrospect, America&rsquo;s leniency towards the Japanese was unneeded. They commited war crimes in China and also conducted experiments on the Chinese people, which were completely deplorable acts. A country that had to deal with war crimes is Yugoslavia, a country that was invaded by Germany in World War II. After World War I, the country of Yugoslavia was created after Austria-Hungary was divided. Yugoslavia was doomed from the beginning, as having multiple cultures of people united in one country is the reason for division in the first place. After Yugoslavia was conquered, the Soviet Union reconquered it and established it as a puppet state. However, like the Sino-Soviet split, Yugoslavia decided to distance itself from the Soviet Union. This is the antithesis of the Sino-Soviet split, as for China which prospered as a nation, Yugoslavia did not, and had multiple civil wars. Today, it is divided into Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro, Kosovo, and Northern Macedonia. Up north from the Balkans and most of Europe, is a shining example of what the antithesis of Russia is; functioning democracies with no corruption. Norway, a nation who owns oil off the coast of their nation, is one of the least corrupt nations in the world. Oil is known to be the catalyst for corruption in nations, and even some nations require oil in their economy. Norway itself has 20% of its economy on oil and gas exports, making it one of the greater juxtapositions to nations like Saudi Arabia and Russia, because with Norway, they use the money gained from the exports as a cushion for any great depressions or troughs in the global economy. As well as that, the United States has no reason to capture Norway and place a dictator allied to the United States, due to the existence of NATO. Another example of a Nordic nation with small amounts of corruption and a great form of democracy is Sweden. Sweden, unlike Norway, does not control oil fields and therefore does not have to deal with the threat of corruption. Sweden has almost twice the amount of people in Norway, making it more difficult for elections to be fair and corruption may be more likely, in reference to population size. Usually, the higher the population of a country, the harder it is to instate a working and functional democracy without any form of corruption ruining it. Most people think that every person has the right to have a voice in the government (including the United States government itself, this is shown during the Cold War when proxy wars occurred, and Afghanistan had a dictator put in place against the Soviet Union invading.). As mentioned before, putting democracies in state will cause the population to not trust the government. This leads us to our third Nordic nation: Denmark. Getting to Denmark is a phrase commonly said in political books and science, since Denmark is one of the leading social democracies that helps the people. The only reason They already have strict anti-corruption laws existing to prevent it from occurring in the first place. The ideology we have talked about many times before in this &ldquo;passage&rdquo; is communism. Another reason to add onto the pile up of reasons on why the Soviet Union Eastern Bloc collapsed is due to the governments held in place in the puppet states set up by Russia, were not set for the people&rsquo;s opinions in mind. However, putting a juxtaposition on two humans will vary greatly. This is why usually there are more representative republics (parliamentary democracies and presidential democracies) than direct democracies, as trusting that the whole population of a country will help the government and foreign policy of a country work is rather difficult. The expansion of Italy during the interwar period was more of a soliloquy that no one paid attention to during the duration it occurred. However, when the buildup is compared to the swift industrial acquisition the Germans did during 1933-1939, it seems that Italy is more of a failed Germany on the surface. However, due to the incompetence of many nationalist leaders in power of the country the travesty that is Italy now becomes more of a dictatorship&rsquo;s flaws; Dictatorships are well known to fluctuate according to the amount of brainwash, morale and competence there is in the country. Italians had almost acquired all three prerequisites in order to succeed like the Germans did. In the Iberian Peninsula, there were two major powers attempting to control dominance of the world at the time, which was Portugal and Spain. Spanish conquests were simply amazing, being able to take over almost the entirety of South America and Central America. Spain became rich off of these profits during this time, however Portugal did as well. Portugal managed to get to the other side of the world when a line was drawn by the Pope when the new continents were discovered. The unification of Italy was somewhat similar to that of Germany, however they did not have to war for it. Russia, like Italy and Germany (and almost every single other country in the world), had to go under unification. However, instead of them still being unified like Germany and Italy after two world wars, Russia collapsed spectacularly. A client state created by the Soviet Union and also administered by Germany during World War II named Slovakia seems to have resemblances to the division of Yugoslavia, however in a more peaceful direction which is more of an antithesis instead of a resemblance. If you were to compare Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia, administering the amount of cultures within them, you could find a split between their overlords (Yugo-Soviet split and their influence vs. Soviet Control over Czechoslovakia) can lead to a peaceful partition or an aggressive civil war. Slovakia seems to have been a nation that had been controlled by many foreign powers, and for good reason, the region could be seen as rather strategic, with mountains covering most of the land making invasion difficult. For example, if Poland were to own Slovakia, they would not have to worry about an invasion by Hungary due to the mountains in the way. This goes for Hungary as well, and in fact for most of Slovakia&rsquo;s history, it was actually controlled by Hungary. The existence of Slovakia may as well be held to Nazi Germany as, like I said before, Slovakia was set up as a puppet regime. Surprisingly, influence over the formed nation by Germany does not affect them today, nor does the Soviet puppet regime that was still Czechoslovakia at that time. This may be due to the fact that we have nothing to compare the government to, other than the Czech Republic. It would be assumed that due to Czechia and Slovakia being joined together for almost the entirety of their countries lifetimes, however this is false, as I&rsquo;ll go onto soon. Unsurprisingly, due to Slovakia&rsquo;s proximity to the Soviet Union during the cold war allowing easier control of the region; in the 1990s Czechia was more prosperous than Slovakia. Their GDP Per Capita was higher than Slovakia, perhaps due to how the Czech Republic was trading with other nations (one of them being the United States, Slovakia on the other hand, did not have the United States as a major trade partner.). Slovakia, during World War II, was an enemy of the United Kingdom, however as you know the overlord of Slovakia, Germany was not able to defeat the United Kingdom. Why is that? Well, it all began when England united with Scotland, leading to the entirety of the United Kingdom being united. Due to that, it became trivially easy for the United Kingdom to defend itself in a war. This is likely the reason why the United Kingdom became a major colonial power, they did not have to worry about land invasions, and they haven&rsquo;t even been invaded on land since 1066. They would be able to focus on colonizing other continents, such as Australia and North America. The only way the United Kingdom would be able to fall is by incompetent leaders, and since 1066, that has not occurred. The only time the United Kingdom had somewhat incompetent leaders is during the American Revolution, where they weren&rsquo;t able to stop a rebellion. Comparing the United Kingdom to Russia shows that the reason why Russia wasn&rsquo;t able to be such a great colonial power, and more of a great power on the European stage. What made Russia becoming a colonial power so difficult is that most of their ports usually freeze up during the winter, so controlling any form of colony would be difficult. To see what this is like, this is as if all of the United Kingdom&rsquo;s ports froze in the winter during the American Revolution. What Russia gains in expense of this is the difficulty to invade Russia. This has been shown two times in history, during the Napoleonic Wars and World War II. And the only time Russia lost from an invasion in Europe was due to incompetence, which is a major factor in every country as I&rsquo;ve made an example through the United Kingdom. The only thing stopping the United Kingdom (in the past, now you can just nuke them with air superiority in mind) is their economy and a superior form of navy. American manifest destiny that has aroused from British incompetence seems to be the worst mistake a country has made. Not only did they lead to their ultimate fall as a global superpower during the cold war and not being able to control the United States, but they also led to the deaths of many different cultures within North America itself for their manifest destiny. Russian fear of the United Kingdom conquering Alaska led to one of the cheapest and greatest purchases that will show itself in the next century. Due to climate change, the temperatures around the world are changing drastically, and it would be essential to control one of the polar regions, that being Alaska. However, for Russia, they have the entirety of Siberia on their side, allowing them to control a temperate climate within there. As well as that, there are likely many resources within Siberia that could be used to their advantage. The Philippines was one of the nations resulting from Spanish imperialism and US manifest destiny, as the United States conquered the Philippines, and liberated Cuba from the rule of Spain. As you know though, conquering nations without their consent leads to rebellions, and of course Filipino people rebelled. However, in the process, these people were fighting a war for nothing as they lost the war and were still owned by the United States. Years later though, they would be invaded again by Japan, who in fact were extremely worse than the United States occupation in the country. However, as you know, the Philippines was liberated once more, however at a cost of one million people out of 18 million. One year after the liberation, the Philippines declared independence from United States rule. There is a reason why they kept staying with the United States afterwards, mainly due to their low amount of supplies and resources to fund an army to defend themselves. During this duration, it would&rsquo;ve been better for the Philippines to stay with the United States to defend themselves. A nation located near the United States and is undergoing rapid inflation in its economy is Venezuela. I&rsquo;ve already talked about the revolutions in South America, however in this case that&rsquo;s not the cause of the rapid inflation. As usual, the leading factor of why there is inflation in the country is incompetence and bad leadership. Printing money is not a viable option to help the economy or pay off debt, as it only makes things worse. The value of a currency is decided by the people, and usually there is a fixed amount of money in a country. If there&rsquo;s more than just a fixed amount of currency located within the country it causes the value of the currency to drop. Competition is human nature. We always want to be better than someone else in some way or form. Do not be afraid of being competitive. Be competitive. Be the best you can. Being competitive is how you grow as a person, whether you like it or not. Nations are the best representation of this. They want to control over resources, and be better than others. They want full influence over the world. However, being competitive can make you shortsighted and not see the bigger picture, and just yourself. You may think you&rsquo;re the center of everything, but you&rsquo;re not. No one is. No matter how powerful a person is or no matter how powerful a person may seem like, they are not the center. There will always be something bigger and greater than everything else. Many people cannot realize this. This, and everything else involved, makes Russia a volatile nation, especially during the early stages of its independence.</p>
